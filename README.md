# MedSpoke Code Challenges

This repository hosts challenges for MedSpoke recruitment process. Even though they are just imaginary exercises, we did our best to make them reflect the process and tools that we use in day-to-day development.

## Rules

* We prefer fully-baked, correct solutions that will make our engineer souls happy, so please take your time - there is no strict time limit
* At the same time please don't overdo it - if your solution does what is required, and you're happy with it, most probably we will be too
* Submit the challenges via [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) to our development team (dev@medspoke.com)
 
## What are we looking for?

* **Clarity** - We are looking for a code than can be understood right away by every developer in the team 

* **Simplicity** - We prefer to start from simple, easily-extendable solutions instead of building complex constructions that will never be used

* **Attention to detail** - We try to think of all possible real-world use cases to prevent number of bugs and improve user exeperience once feature goes live

## What happens after submission?

Once you submit your solution to us via `git format-patch`, our dev team will review the code. It might take us up to 1 week to get back to you with some feedback. If your solution is accepted, we will invite you for a next step of the recruitment process.
